// Atomic Operations

// This method makes three different calls to buf â€” to convert it to a string in order to search for s, 
// to delete the old text, 
// and then to insert t in its place. Even though each of these calls individually is atomic, 
// the findReplace method as a whole is not threadsafe, because other threads might mutate the buffer while findReplace is working, 
// causing it to delete the wrong region or put the replacement back in the wrong place.

// To prevent this, findReplace needs to synchronize with all other clients of buf.

     * Modifies buf by replacing the first occurrence of s with t.
     * If s not found in buf, then has no effect.
     * @returns true if and only if a replacement was made

        // into a single atomic region that ensures that all three methods are executed without interference from other threads.
