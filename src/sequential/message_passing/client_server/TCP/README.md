# Simple Client / Server Interactions with Stream Sockets Connections (TCP)
This repository contains code examples from **Java: How To Program** [JHTP](https://www.pearsonhighered.com/product/Deitel-Java-How-to-Program-early-objects-9th-Edition/9780132575669.html).

All the examples were written using Eclipse and Java 8.

#### Code Examples:
1. **Server**
   * Clients can only interact with the **_Blocking_** server one at a time, i.e. the Server is not using **_multi-threading_**
   * Server.java: Server "Blocking" portion of a client/server stream-socket connection
   * StartServer.java: Starts the Server
2. **Client**
   * Client.java: Client portion of a client/server stream-socket connection
   * StartClient.java: Starts a Client
